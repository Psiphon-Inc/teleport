// WHY TRANSITIVE MEMBERSHIP IS GONE. It did not work, and buying the ability
// to use it was poor value. Measured against a live Workspace Business Plus
// tenant on 2026-08-09, with one end-user access token:
//
//	searchTransitiveGroups -> 403 "Error(4013): Insufficient permissions to
//	                          retrieve memberships", with no reason token in
//	                          the error body at all
//	searchDirectGroups     -> 200, 30 groups
//
// Same token, same scope, same OAuth client, same Google project, seconds
// apart. That comparison rules out an insufficient scope, a disabled API, an
// OAuth client the tenant does not trust, and group visibility, which returns
// an empty 200 rather than a 403. The remaining explanation is that the tenant
// is not entitled to transitive search. That is inferred and not proven: the
// message names permissions, not licensing.
//
// The entitlement was not worth buying, because the lookup uses the access
// token of the user who is logging in. Every user who logs in would need it,
// not one administrator or one service account.
//
// THE COST OF DIRECT MEMBERSHIP, which an operator must plan around. Direct
// membership does not follow nesting. If a connector maps a group that
// CONTAINS another group, a member of only the inner group gets no roles from
// that mapping.
//
// The direction of that failure is safe. Direct membership is a strict subset
// of transitive membership, so this fork can only ever grant fewer roles than
// a transitive lookup would, never more. It cannot over-grant.
//
// It is, however, SILENT. The login succeeds, the audit event records
// group_lookup_succeeded, and the user simply holds less access than intended.
// Nothing distinguishes "in no mapped group" from "in a mapped group through
// nesting, which cannot be seen". Keep mapped groups flat, or accept that a
// nested member gets nothing. Making this loud is ref-cw3n.
