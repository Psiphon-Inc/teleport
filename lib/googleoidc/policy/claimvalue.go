// A claims_to_roles value is not a literal string. Teleport compiles it in
// lib/utils/replace.go, and the login path uses that compiled matcher in
// lib/services/traits.go. Two rules make a denylist useless there.
//
//  1. A plain value goes through utils.GlobToRegexp, which quotes every
//     character and then turns each * into (.*). So ** and *@* match every
//     address.
//  2. A value that starts with ^ and ends with $ is passed to the regexp
//     engine unescaped. So ^(.*)$ matches every address, and ^.*@example.com$
//     also matches victim@exampleXcom, a domain an attacker can register.
//
// The fork therefore validates the value as written, against an allow-list
// grammar, and rejects everything the grammar does not name. See ref-y0gu.20.
