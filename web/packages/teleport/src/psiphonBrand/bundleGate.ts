/**
 * Layer 2 of the brand gate. It reads the emitted bundle, so it measures what
 * ships. It is the step that proves the plugin actually ran, and it is what
 * makes the build-time transform safe: a build that skipped the plugin cannot
 * pass it.
 *
 * ENFORCEMENT SWITCHES ITSELF ON. While the source baseline still admits a
 * phrase, the bundle necessarily still holds unbranded copy, so the gate
 * reports and does not throw. When the aggregate source baseline reaches zero,
 * `isBundleGateStrict` becomes true on its own, with no further commit.
 *
 * FOUR THINGS ACCOUNT FOR AN OCCURRENCE, and nothing else does.
 *
 *   1. A catalog entry, matched by its replacement text.
 *   2. An excluded host from `EXCLUDED_HOSTS`.
 *   3. A record or a named rule in `bundleBaseline.ts`, for the occurrences a
 *      source-keyed catalog entry can never reach.
 *   4. A namespace literal in `bundleBaseline.ts`, for the three occurrences
 *      where the WHOLE string is the bare lower-case word. A record cannot be
 *      that short, by a guard this file must not weaken, so those three get a
 *      separate type with a narrower key and a HARD CAP on how many
 *      occurrences it may take.
 *
 * The third and fourth lists have THEIR OWN RATCHET, in
 * `evaluateBundleBaseline`, and that ratchet does not wait for strict mode. A
 * record that stops matching fails the build until somebody removes it, so
 * both lists can only shrink.

/**
 * THE BOUNDED LITERAL REGION.
 *
 * A catalog entry is normally consumed here by searching the chunk for
 * `entry.replacement` as a plain substring. Two kinds of entry defeat that
 * search, and both defeat it for the same reason: the chunk does not hold the
 * replacement text byte for byte.
 *
 *   1. A TEMPLATE ENTRY. When the source is a template literal WITH `${...}`
 *      expressions and the replacement keeps the brand word, the catalog holds
 *      author-written expression text such as `${moduleSrc}` and the minified
 *      chunk holds `${i}`. The literal spans between the expressions, the
 *      QUASIS, are what can be matched.
 *   2. AN ESCAPED DOLLAR-BRACE. The catalog holds one backslash before `${`.
 *      The template rewrite escapes the backslash and `${`. The chunk holds
 *      three backslashes, but babel still records all of this text as a quasi.
 *   3. A WHOLE-NODE ENTRY. `sortLongestFirst` drops one, and that filter is
 *      correct: a chunk has no AST nodes, so the only thing a substring reader
 *      could do with an immutable bare-word entry is account every lower-case
 *      occurrence in the product in one sweep. `ref-o74l.3.10` measured that it
 *      would hide 401 unaccounted runs. The chunk-side analogue of a whole node
 *      is a COMPLETE QUOTED STRING, which is the same idea
 *      `namespaceLiteralMatches` already uses for amendment 8.
 *
 * ONE MECHANISM SERVES ALL THREE. Match the entry's quasi sequence, in order,
 * against a complete quoted string: the character before the first quasi and
 * the character after the last quasi must be the SAME quote, and every gap
 * between two quasis must be an expression span. A whole-node entry has one
 * quasi and no gap, so it degenerates to "a complete quoted string equal to the
 * replacement", which is amendment 8's shape without the anchor.
 *
 * WHAT IS CONSUMED IS ONLY THE QUASI TEXT, never the expression text. The
 * catalog provably produced the quasis. It did not produce the minified
 * expression, so an occurrence inside one is still reported unless an
 * identifier record accounts it.
 *
 * TWO SHAPES OF GAP, because two transforms lower a template two ways.
 *
 *   `${...}`, when the template reached the chunk as a template literal.
 *   `` `,` ``, when the template was TAGGED and the transform lowered it to a
 *   call over an array of its quasis, which is what every styled-components
 *   block in `web/packages/design/src` becomes. The quasis are then adjacent
 *   array elements, so the gap is a closing quote, a comma and an opening
 *   quote, with the same quote character on both sides.
 *
 * THE SHORT-QUASI RULE, and why it is the rule the exclusion list already uses.
 * A quasi is consumed only when its non-whitespace length is STRICTLY GREATER
 * than the brand word, so a quasi that is the bare word and nothing else
 * carries no context and takes nothing. The one exception is an entry that
 * DECLARES `match: 'wholeNode'`, which amendment 7 guards at four separate
 * places in the source readers. That declaration, and not a length, is what
 * admits the bare word here. The pair of rules mirrors
 * `validateBundleBaseline`: a record must be longer than the brand word, a
 * namespace literal must BE it, and neither is a relaxation of the other.
 *
 * AN EMPTY QUASI IS SAFE AND IS NOT A SPECIAL CASE. It requires nothing of its
 * own, and its neighbours become adjacent: a leading empty quasi forces the
 * region to open with `` `${ ``, a trailing one forces it to close with
 * `` }` ``, and one between two expressions forces `}${`. Its evidence length
 * is zero, so it can never take an occurrence either.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS EVIDENCE INSIDE A BOUNDED REGION, and only inside one. The
 * styled-components transform MINIFIES the CSS it lowers. Two things it
 * deletes therefore cannot be compared at all, and a byte comparison would
 * fail a strict build for ever on both.
 *
 *   WHITESPACE. `input:enabled:hover + &,\n  .teleport-x` reaches the chunk as
 *   `input:enabled:hover + &,.teleport-x`.
 *   A COMMENT. `\n  // reset the appearance so we can style the background`
 *   reaches the chunk as nothing at all.
 *
 * The quasi comparison therefore compares EVIDENCE: the characters that are
 * neither whitespace nor inside a comment, in order. A `//` comment counts
 * only at the start of a line, so a `//` inside a URL stays evidence. A
 * genuine miss differs in an evidence character and is still reported, which
 * `bundleGate.test.ts` proves for both a changed class name and a changed
 * word. The tolerance is confined to a region already pinned at both ends by a
 * quote, and the plain substring pass below stays byte exact.

/**
 * Find every occurrence of the brand word in one emitted chunk that neither a

 *
 * The bundle holds the REPLACEMENT text, not the source text, so the catalog is
 * consumed by replacement. In practice only an immutable entry keeps the word,
 * which is exactly why ADR 0007 keeps all five immutable entries: without them
 * this layer cannot tell a header it must leave alone from a phrase somebody
 * forgot.
 *
 * THE CATALOG IS READ IN TWO PASSES, and the narrower claim goes first.
 *
 *   Pass A, the bounded literal region. A template entry and a whole-node entry
 *   are matched by their quasi sequence inside a complete quoted string. See
 *   "THE BOUNDED LITERAL REGION" above for why a plain substring search cannot
 *   reach either of them.
 *
 *   Pass B, the plain substring search, longest replacement first, byte exact,
 *   as before. It also searches for the character-reference-decoded form of a
 *   replacement, because a JSX text node reaches the chunk decoded. A template
 *   entry stays in this pass too, because an unminified build holds the
 *   replacement verbatim and the pass costs nothing.
 *
 * A NAMESPACE LITERAL OUTRANKS PASS A. `BUNDLE_NAMESPACE_LITERALS` names three
 * anchored sites whose whole string is the bare lower-case word, and each one
 * carries a HARD CAP. The whole-node catalog entry for the same word would take
 * them first and leave those records matching nothing, which is
 * `BUNDLE_RATCHET_FAIL`. Pass A therefore refuses any region holding an
 * occurrence a namespace literal has claimed, so each mechanism keeps the sites
 * it was measured against.
