/**
 * The dated bundle-side exclusion list for layer 2 of the brand gate.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Layer 1 reads source and accounts a phrase with a catalog
 * entry. Layer 2 reads the emitted bundle. Some occurrences in the bundle have
 * no source-side representation that a content-keyed catalog entry can ever
 * reach, so layer 1 cannot account them and layer 2 would fail forever. This
 * file names those occurrences, with a reason each, and it carries its own
 * ratchet so it can only shrink.
 *
 * WHAT MAY GO IN IT. An occurrence belongs here only when a catalog entry
 * cannot address it. Measured on 2026-08-19 there are exactly two such
 * reasons, and every record below states which one applies.
 *
 *   1. The occurrence is an identifier or a property name. ADR 0007 "The
 *      algorithm" step 2 forbids the scanner from visiting an identifier, so
 *      no `source` string can ever name one.
 *   2. The occurrence comes from a module outside the layer 1 scan set and
 *      outside `shouldTransform`. That set is `.ts` and `.tsx` under
 *      `web/packages/teleport/src`, `web/packages/design/src` and
 *      `web/packages/shared`. A dependency, a generated protobuf module and a
 *      `.jsx` module all sit outside it.
 *
 * WHAT MAY NOT GO IN IT. Copy. An unbranded phrase that a user reads belongs
 * in a catalog leaf or, until an authoring child reaches it, in that leaf's
 * source baseline. Two structural guards enforce this, and `bundleGate.test.ts`
 * asserts both: no record may hold the bare brand word, and every record must
 * be strictly longer than it. A record or a rule that could match a lone
 * `Teleport` is rejected before any bundle is read.
 *
 * THE RATCHET. Every record and every rule must match at least one occurrence
 * in the emitted bundle. One that matches nothing fails the build until
 * somebody removes it. The ratchet does not wait for strict mode, because it
 * measures the health of this file and not the state of the rebrand.
 *
 * The ratchet is on presence, not on count. `count` records what was measured
 * and the report prints the drift, but a changed count never fails the build.
 * Keying a hard failure on an occurrence count would fire on any dependency
 * bump that adds one CSS selector, and a gate that cries wolf gets deleted.
 *
 * A THIRD MECHANISM SITS BELOW, and it is deliberately separate. Three
 * occurrences in the bundle are a WHOLE string equal to the bare lower-case
 * brand word, so no record can name them: the structural guard above forbids a
 * record as short as the brand word, and that guard is what keeps copy out.
 * All three are the `@gravitational/design-system` CSS variable namespace, and
 * the operator decided on 2026-08-19 to keep that namespace as `teleport`,
 * because it is a dependency boundary. `BUNDLE_NAMESPACE_LITERALS` is their
 * home. Read the comment on that constant before you add to it.
 *
 * ONE MEASURED GAP IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN THIS FILE, and never will be. It was
 * user-visible copy at `AuthConnectors/templates/github.yaml:16`, which the
 * GitHub connector editor shows to a user. It reached the bundle through
 * `?raw`, so neither the layer 1 scan set nor `shouldTransform` saw it. It is
 * copy, so it could not come here. `ref-o74l.3.6` measured the family it
 * belongs to: 17 `?raw` imports in the tree, all of them `.yaml?raw`, of which
 * 2 files hold the brand word and 1 of those 2 holds it only inside
 * `goteleport.com`, which `EXCLUDED_HOSTS` already accounts. One file and one
 * line, so the fork edits that line rather than growing the transform for it.
 * `bundleGate.test.ts` reads every `?raw` asset in the tree and fails when any
 * of them holds the brand word outside an excluded host.

 *   protobuf name, a kebab CSS class and a slashed path whole.
 * - `identifier`: the longest run of `[A-Za-z0-9_$]` around the occurrence.
 *   Use this when the token would drag in a neighbouring minified name, as
 *   `e.validTeleportConfig` does. The identifier is `validTeleportConfig`,

/**
 * One whole string literal in the bundle whose entire content is the bare

 *
 * WHY THIS TYPE EXISTS AT ALL. `BundleExclusion` cannot express one of these,
 * and it must not learn how. Its guard rejects any token that is not strictly
 * longer than the brand word, and that guard is the only thing standing
 * between the exclusion list and a record that swallows every `Teleport` in
 * the product. So the three occurrences get a separate type with a separate
 * guard, rather than a loosened shared one.
 *
 * WHY IT CANNOT ADMIT COPY. Three conditions must hold at once, and the first
 * two are not configurable.
 *
 *   1. The matched text is exactly `teleport`, in lower case. `literal` is
 *      validated against `BRAND_WORD` for equality, so the set of literals a
 *      record can name has exactly one member. `Teleport` is unexpressible,
 *      and so is every phrase.
 *   2. The character before the match and the character after it are the SAME
 *      quote character. The match is therefore a complete string literal, not
 *      a word inside one. `"Welcome to Teleport"` fails on condition 1 and on
 *      condition 2. `"Welcome to teleport"` passes condition 1 on the word but
 *      fails condition 2, because the character before it is a space.
 *   3. The exact text in `anchor` immediately precedes the opening quote, and
 *      `anchor` ends in a structural character. This pins each record to one
 *      code position instead of to a shape, so the mechanism cannot quietly
 *      absorb an occurrence it was not written for.
 *
 * WHAT IT COULD ADMIT THAT IT SHOULD NOT, stated plainly: a user-visible
 * string whose WHOLE text is the single lower-case word `teleport`, sitting at
 * one of the three anchored positions. A one-word label, placeholder or
 * tooltip is the realistic case. Two things bound that risk. Each record names
 * its site in `site`, so a reader can check it. And `count` is a HARD CAP:
 * `evaluateBundleBaseline` fails the build when a record matches more times
 * than it records, unlike the count on a `BundleExclusion`, which only drifts.
 * A fourth occurrence at an anchored position therefore stops the build
 * instead of being absorbed.
